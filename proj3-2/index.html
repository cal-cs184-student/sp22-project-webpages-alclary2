  <h1 align="middle">Project 3-2: Pathtracer 2</h1>
  <h2 align="middle">Anna Clary</h2>

  <br><br>

<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
  <p> This project built upon the previous project, 3-1, by adding some fun new features. For my two parts I
	   completed part 1 and part 4. Part 1 focused on rendering mirrored and glass type objects. It was really 
	   interesting doing the different max_ray_depths to really visualize the different bounces of light and how 
	   they change the scene. Part 4 changed the camera model from pinhole to thin-lens, which helped to render more 
	   realistic scenes with different levels of focus. Similar to how a human eye or something like portrait mode 
	   blurs out portions of the scene. I really enjoyed completing this project and I wish I would have had time 
	   to complete all the parts, however I really like the ones I ended up choosing. 
  </p>

<h3>Breakdown of the Bounces on Above Images</h3>
<ul>
	<li>A: only areas that emit light themselves aka the ceiling light source, can be seen</li>
	<li>B: Direct illumination can now be seen, including the highlights on the tops of both of the spheres</li>
	<li>C: The mirror ball on the left is now reflecting light through indirect illumination. It is not fully rendered 
		correctly yet seeing as the ceiling in the reflection is black and not like the white rendered one in the image. 
		So an extra bounce is needed to fully render the details of the box in the mirrored reflection. Similarly for the 
		glass ball on the right you can see the reflecting light portions minus some box details. However the majority of 
		it remains black as the refracted light needs another bounce in order to exit the ball.
	</li>
	<li>D: The mirror ball now has the ceiling rendered correctly, however the reflection of the glass ball in it remains black 
		as the glass ball was before. The glass ball officially looks like glass now!! The light refracted under the glass ball 
		can now be seen as well, showing that this (3rd) bounce meant that light was able to properly exit.
	</li>
	<li>E: The mirror ball looks how you would expect now, with the glass ball reflecting properly. Looking just at the mirror ball 
		in the remaining images you will see very little change. In terms of the glass ball it is brighter as more bounces are occurring. 
		There is now a light spot on the wall as the light is reflected from the mirror ball, refracted within the glass ball and then hits 
		the wall. This new bounce also results in light being reflected onto the bottom of the glass ball from the refracted light underneath.
	</li>
	<li>F: Nothing major changes. Things seem to have settled.</li>
	<li>G: No discernible changes from the previous image. Seems a bit noisier as more reflections and refractions are occuring. </li>
</ul>
<br><br>


<h3>Debug:</h3>
<p>This one gave me a bit of a headache. I was having an issue where after part 3 none of my refracted light was being rendered.
	So the sphere on the right was showing up completely black. Turns out I had parentheses around something in my inner square 
	root function that I shouldn't have. So it was giving me very wrong values.

<h3>Pinhole vs. Thin-lens Camera Model:</h3>
<p>The “pinhole” camera model is one that works on the assumption that everything 
	within the frame is in focus no matter the distance. So far this is the model that 
	has been used to create all our images, however it is not necessarily the most 
	accurate to cameras or the human eye. In comes the “thin-lens” camera model. This 
	particular model renders parts of the images in focus and other out of focus dependent 
	on the lens size (aperture) and focal distance. Code wise this model differs in that 
	instead of simply tracing a ray straight through a “pinhole”, the ray is traced but 
	the direction is changed after passing through the lens.
</p>

<br><br>
<p>Note: I tried to create some more interesting angles to really show this off, but I kept 
	getting tripped up with the camera.txt files and my computer just could not handle doing 
	it via the gui so this is what I ended up with. I still think it does a really good job 
	of showing the changes :) just not quite as fun as I was hoping. 
</p>

<h3>Focus Stack:</h3>
<p>As the focus depth is increase you can see how the areas in focus move from the front of the dragon 
	around the mouth, along the dragon's body (snout gets blurry), and  ultimately in the last image to solely the back corner.

		</td>
	  </tr>
	</table>
</div>

<br><br>

<h3>Aperture Size Change:</h3>
<p>As the aperture size increases (with the focus depth the same) the blurriness of the images increases, making 
	the in-focus areas of the dragon's front stand out much more.

	  </tr>
	</table>
</div>
<h3>Debug:</h3>
<p>The debug for this part wasn't too bad, most of my errors originally came from me copying my code from
	project 3-1 and not properly editing out portions I did not need.
